    "Training Data Size": "472,432 transactions",
    "Validation Data Size": "118,108 transactions",
    "Development Period": "January 2026",
    "Version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "Performance Metrics": {
    "Primary Metric": "PR-AUC = 0.4268 (12x better than random)",
    "ROC-AUC": "0.8789",
    "Precision @ threshold": "33.6% (95th percentile)",
    "Recall @ threshold": "48.9% (95th percentile)",
    "Overfitting Gap": "15.0% (within acceptable range)",
    "Statistical Confidence": "95% CI: [0.4089, 0.4421]"
  },
  "Training Data": {
    "Source": "IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset",
    "Time Period": "Historical transactions (2024)",
    "Fraud Rate": "3.51%",
    "Class Imbalance": "1:28 ratio",
    "Geographic Coverage": "Global",
    "Preprocessing": "Frequency encoding, label encoding, standard scaling"
  },
  "Validation Approach": {
    "Method": "Time-based train/valid split (80/20)",
    "Temporal Ordering": "Preserved (no future data leakage)",
    "Cross-Validation": "Time-series aware",
    "Bootstrap Analysis": "1000 iterations for confidence intervals",
    "Stability Testing": "4 time windows (Q1-Q4)"
  },
  "Limitations": {
    "Known Issues": [
      "Precision 33.6% means 2/3 of flags are false positives",
      "Misses ~51% of fraud at 95th percentile threshold",
      "Temporal performance variability (CV 12.6%)",
      "Requires 479 features (high complexity)",
      "Sensitive to feature distribution shift"
    ],
    "Assumptions": [
      "Past fraud patterns predict future fraud",
      "Feature relationships remain stable",
      "Data quality maintained (<5% missing)",
      "Fraud patterns evolve slowly (<monthly)"
    ]
  },
  "Ethical Considerations": {
    "Potential Harms": [
      "False positives frustrate legitimate customers",
      "Potential disparate impact on customer segments",
      "Over-reliance reduces human judgment"
    ],
    "Mitigations": [
      "Human review required for all flagged transactions",
      "Customer override and appeal process",
      "Quarterly fairness audits",
      "Transparent communication about automated scoring"
